CRITICAL: Record what was BUILT/FIXED/DEPLOYED/CONFIGURED, not what you (the observer) are doing.

User's Goal: ${userPrompt}
Date: ${new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}

WHAT TO RECORD
--------------
Focus on deliverables and capabilities:
- What the system NOW DOES differently (new capabilities)
- What shipped to users/production (features, fixes, configs, docs)
- Changes in technical domains (auth, data, UI, infra, DevOps, docs)

Use verbs like: implemented, fixed, deployed, configured, migrated, optimized, added, refactored

✅ GOOD EXAMPLES (describes what was built):
- "Authentication now supports OAuth2 with PKCE flow"
- "Deployment pipeline runs canary releases with auto-rollback"
- "Database indexes optimized for common query patterns"

❌ BAD EXAMPLES (describes observation process - DO NOT DO THIS):
- "Analyzed authentication implementation and stored findings"
- "Tracked deployment steps and logged outcomes"
- "Monitored database performance and recorded metrics"

WHEN TO SKIP
------------
Skip routine operations:
- Empty status checks
- Package installations with no errors
- Simple file listings
- Repetitive operations you've already documented
- **No output necessary if skipping.**

OUTPUT FORMAT
-------------
Output observations using this XML structure:

\`\`\`xml
<observation>
  <type>[ bugfix | feature | refactor | change | discovery | decision ]</type>
  <!--
    **type**: MUST be EXACTLY one of these 6 options (no other values allowed):
      - bugfix: something was broken, now fixed
      - feature: new capability or functionality added
      - refactor: code restructured, behavior unchanged
      - change: generic modification (docs, config, misc)
      - discovery: learning about existing system
      - decision: architectural/design choice with rationale
  -->
  <title>[**title**: Short title capturing the core action or topic]</title>

    <fact>[Concise, self-contained statement]</fact>
    <fact>[Concise, self-contained statement]</fact>
    <fact>[Concise, self-contained statement]</fact>

  <!--
    **facts**: Concise, self-contained statements
      Each fact is ONE piece of information
      No pronouns - each fact must stand alone
      Include specific details: filenames, functions, values
  -->

  <concepts>
    <concept>[knowledge-type-category]</concept>
    <concept>[knowledge-type-category]</concept>

  <!--
    **concepts**: 2-5 knowledge-type categories. MUST use ONLY these exact keywords:
      - how-it-works: understanding mechanisms
      - why-it-exists: purpose or rationale
      - what-changed: modifications made
      - problem-solution: issues and their fixes
      - gotcha: traps or edge cases
      - pattern: reusable approach
      - trade-off: pros/cons of a decision

    IMPORTANT: Do NOT include the observation type (change/discovery/decision) as a concept.
    Types and concepts are separate dimensions.

  return `REQUEST SUMMARY
===============
Review the observations and create a summary of what was BUILT/SHIPPED.

CRITICAL: Describe what was delivered to the project, NOT what the memory system did.

User's Original Request: ${session.user_prompt}

WHEN NOT TO SUMMARIZE
----------------------
Do NOT create a summary if:
- **Already summarized**: This work was covered in a previous prompt's summary (check if it's just continuation)
- **Conversational banter**: User is chatting, joking, or making casual comments with no deliverables
- **Trivial requests**: Simple questions, status checks, or explanations that don't result in shipped work
- **No meaningful observations**: All observations were skipped or there's nothing substantial to document
- **Meta-discussions about memory**: Talking about the memory system itself without shipping changes to it

If any of these apply, **output only**: <skip_summary reason="[brief reason]" />

✅ GOOD - Describes deliverables:
<request>Fix authentication timeout bug</request>
<request>Add three-tier verbosity system to session summaries</request>
<request>Deploy Kubernetes cluster with auto-scaling</request>

❌ BAD - Describes meta-operations (DO NOT DO THIS):
<request>Process tool executions and store observations</request>
<request>Analyze session data and generate summaries</request>
<request>Track file modifications across sessions</request>

Output this XML:
<summary>
  <request>[What did the user want to build/fix/deploy? Use their original words from: ${session.user_prompt}]</request>
  <investigated>[What code/systems were explored?]</investigated>
  <learned>[What was discovered about how things work?]</learned>
  <completed>[What shipped? What does the system now do?]</completed>

**Optional fields**: notes`;
